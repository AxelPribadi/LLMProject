# LLM Project

## Overview

The LLM Project is a machine learning application designed to analyze text prompts and determine whether they are AI-generated or human-generated
This project leverages a fine-tuned language model to classify text inputs.

This project was created to enhance my skills with LLMs. By developing and deploying a real-world application, I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning models, improve my coding abilities, and explore the practical aspects of LLMs in a scalable environment. I also improved on my JS skills

There are 2 versions for this project:

### Local Development Branch (main)

- **Purpose**: This branch contains scripts and code for local development, including JavaScript and database integration.
- **Features**: Includes setup for running the application locally without the need for deployment costs.
- **Usage**: Ideal for development, testing, and running the application on your local machine.



### Streamlit Deployment (master)

- **Purpose**: This branch contains the Streamlit application code, which is intended for the deployed version of the project.
- **Features**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the model and viewing predictions.
- **Deployment**: Use this branch to deploy the application to cloud platforms or other hosting services.



## Additional Notes
Data source is from Kaggle {insert link here}

LLM Model claims to be 99% accurate though it seems to be overtrained.
This can be reduced by adjusting the learning rate and other hyperparameters.
